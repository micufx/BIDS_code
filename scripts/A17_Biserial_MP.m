%% Point-biserial correlation

% The point-biserial correlation is a specific case of the Pearson
% correlation coefficient that measures the strength and direction of the
% association between a continuous variable and a binary (dichotomous)
% variable. In your context, this method can help determine if there's a
% significant relationship between the features extracted from your EEG
% data (like the standard deviation and mean of signals per trial) and the
% binary outcome of each trial (hit or miss).

% This script computes the point-biserial correlation between each of the
% 30 features and the binary condition for all trials. The results are
% stored in the correlationResults table, which includes the correlation
% coefficient (R_Value) and p-value (P_Value) for each feature.

% The point-biserial correlation is essentially Pearson's
% correlation when one variable is continuous (features in this case) and
% the other is binary (condition, 1 or 0), so using corr with 'Type',
% 'Pearson' is appropriate here. The magnitude of R_Value indicates the
% strength of the relationship between the feature and the condition, while
% the P_Value indicates the statistical significance of this relationship.

% Biserial correlation

% This code calculates the point-biserial correlation coefficient (r) and
% the corresponding p-value (pValue) for both the standard deviation and
% mean features against the trial outcomes. The r value indicates the
% strength and direction of the association, while the pValue assesses the
% statistical significance of this association. A low p-value (typically <
% 0.05) suggests that the observed correlation is unlikely to have occurred
% by chance.

% Correlation Coefficient (r): This measures the strength and direction of
% a linear relationship between two variables. In the context of
% point-biserial correlation, it measures the relationship between a
% continuous variable (e.g., your features such as mean or standard
% deviation) and a binary categorical variable (e.g., hit or miss). The
% value of r ranges from -1 to 1, where: 1 indicates a perfect positive
% linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship,
% 0 indicates no linear relationship. P-value: This indicates the
% probability of observing the data or something more extreme if the null
% hypothesis is true. In this context, the null hypothesis typically states
% that there is no association between the continuous and binary variables.
% A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the
% null hypothesis, suggesting a significant association between the
% variables.

% Interpreting the Results High Positive r Value: Indicates that
% as the continuous feature increases, the likelihood of one category of
% the binary variable (e.g., hit) increases. High Negative r Value:
% Indicates that as the continuous feature increases, the likelihood of the
% opposite category of the binary variable (e.g., miss) increases. P-value
% ≤ 0.05: Suggests that the observed correlation is statistically
% significant, meaning there is a less than 5% chance that the observed
% association is due to random variation alone.

% When it comes to calculating explained variance (R^2), simply squaring
% the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) gives you a measure of how much
% variance in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent
% variable in a linear model. This is appropriate for linear relationships.
% If your features and conditions follow a linear model, squaring the
% correlation coefficient (r^2) indeed gives you the explained variance.

% Using the point-biserial correlation coefficient squared (R^2) can give
% estimate of the explained variance. It indicates how much of the
% variability in the binary outcome can be accounted for by the variance
% in the readiness potential amplitude, under the assumption of a linear
% relationship between these variables. This method can provide valuable
% insights into the strength and significance of the relationship between
% brain activity and performance.
